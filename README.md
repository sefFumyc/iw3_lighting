# iw3_lighting
a mod to add light in iw3
method from t6mvm

## How to use
Use **Extreme Injector** or any Injector to inject dll to your **iw3mp.exe** or **iw3xo.exe**.
it can work in DX9 or DX11.
it can work with iwxmvm(only DX9).

reference_ver/single.cpp is more easy to read, but it cant work together with iwxmvm.
that version doesn't fix the two imgui process clash problem.
